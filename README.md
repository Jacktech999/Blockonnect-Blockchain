### Roadmap
Our development roadmap consists of the following phases:

#### Phase I: Idea Generation
During this stage, the project's conception and development are the primary concerns. Competitors' faults and defects will be examined by team members, and remedies will be proposed.

#### Phase II: Website Development
The platform's website and ecosystem will be launched in this phase.

#### Phase III: Marketing
More individuals buying a token means a higher price because of the increased scarcity. Hence, this stage will focus on reaching more prospective users.

#### Phase IV: Public Launch
The project's formal launch is the focus of this phase.
